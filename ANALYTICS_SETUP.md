   - **Reports > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition**: How people find your site
   - **Reports > Engagement > Pages and screens**: Most popular pages
   - **Reports > Events**: Custom interactions (contact form, downloads)

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage who leave after viewing one page
- **Average Session Duration**: How long people stay
- **Top Pages**: Most visited sections
- **Traffic Sources**: Where visitors come from (Google, LinkedIn, direct, etc.)

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Considerations

The analytics setup includes:

- **No personal data collection**: Only anonymous usage statistics
- **Enhanced measurement settings**: Configured for portfolio sites
- **GDPR compliant**: Basic implementation follows privacy guidelines

### Optional: Add Privacy Policy

Consider adding a simple privacy notice to your footer:

```html
<p>This site uses Google Analytics for anonymous usage statistics.</p>
```

## üöÄ Advanced Features (Optional)

### Google Search Console Integration

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
2. Add your portfolio URL as a property
3. Verify ownership using the Google Analytics method
4. Link it to your Analytics account for SEO insights

### Custom Events

You can track additional interactions by adding calls to the tracking functions:

```javascript
// Track custom button clicks
trackEvent("button_click", {
  button_name: "custom_button",
  section: "about",
});

// Track section views
trackEvent("section_view", {
  section_name: "experience",
});
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Working?

1. **Check Measurement ID**: Ensure it's correctly set in `analytics.js`
2. **Wait 24-48 hours**: Google Analytics can take time to start showing data
3. **Test in incognito**: Use incognito mode to test without blocking your own visits
4. **Check browser console**: Look for any JavaScript errors

### Common Issues

- **Ad blockers**: Some visitors may have ad blockers that prevent tracking
- **JavaScript disabled**: Very rare, but some users might have JS disabled
- **Local development**: Analytics won't work when testing locally

## üìà Expected Timeline

- **Immediate**: Analytics code is active
- **2-4 hours**: First data may appear in Real-time reports
- **24-48 hours**: Full reporting becomes available
- **1 week**: Enough data for meaningful insights
- **1 month**: Comprehensive traffic patterns emerge
